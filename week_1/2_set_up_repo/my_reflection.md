## 2. [Open Source and Repo Setup](2_set_up_repo/readme.md) Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I have had a github account for almost 8 months and I was not really sure of what it was and what it can do. I tried doing my assignments earlier on Github and could not commit (later I learned you need a comment). I learned I should not just give up and think something is wrong with the program, and instead to do more research to find out what error I am making. Git allows you to colloborate with people and track changes on repositories (similar to files). Git is VCM (version control management) which allows users to see the edit the same file- while keeping track of changes. Every time you commit your repository, your code is saved so you can fix a bug or make a big change and always go back to that current state that you committed it in.  Github is a site that allows its users to host git repositories-both publicly and privately. Developers use version control because they can easily work with other people and keep track of changes. 
I dont understand how Github is really that different from something like the cloud (in terms of sharing a document among many people)
