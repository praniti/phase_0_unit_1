The Web is just one of many applications built off the internet. The internet is the entire network of interconnected computers while the world wide web is all the webpages viewed through our web browser.
It is important to use html tags when creating a html site so the computer can tell the difference. My webpage did not work for some reason. I believe it is because I could not intialize this project with a MIT license. I was very confused about how the terminal, github, and sublime were connected, but now I have a better understanding.
