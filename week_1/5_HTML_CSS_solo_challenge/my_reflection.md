I had basic questions about styling and the connection between html and css. I used the DBC online resources. I learned how to create a new build system so I can view sublime on my browser. I am pretty confident with the material. I wish I was able to make my page look less like basic html with the strict paragraphs, boxes, etc. I found the entire challenge enjoyable.
