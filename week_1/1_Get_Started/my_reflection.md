## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection

* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 
* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
* What doesn't make sense? What does?
I have had a github account for almost 8 months and I was not really sure of what it was and what it can do. I tried doing my assignments earlier on Github and could not commit (later I learned you need a comment). I learned I should not just give up and think something is wrong with the program, and instead to do more research to find out what error I am making. Git allows you to colloborate with people and track changes on repositories (similar to files). Git is VCM (version control management) which allows users to see the edit the same file- while keeping track of changes. Every time you commit your repository, your code is saved so you can fix a bug or make a big change and always go back to that current state that you committed it in.  Github is a site that allows its users to host git repositories-both publicly and privately. Developers use version control because they can easily work with other people and keep track of changes. 
I dont understand how Github is really that different from something like the cloud (in terms of sharing a document among many people)
